# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

**Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** is a core concept in computer science that deals with how data is organized, stored, and processed efficiently.  


## 1. Data Structures
A **data structure** is a way of organizing and storing data so it can be used effectively.  
It defines **how data is arranged in memory** and what operations can be performed on it.  

### Examples
- **Array** â€“ stores elements in contiguous memory (fast access, fixed size).  
- **Linked List** â€“ stores elements with pointers (flexible size, slower access).  
- **Stack** â€“ follows *Last In, First Out (LIFO)*.  
- **Queue** â€“ follows *First In, First Out (FIFO)*.  
- **Tree** â€“ hierarchical data (e.g., family tree, file system).  
- **Graph** â€“ set of nodes and edges (e.g., social networks, maps).  
- **Hash Table** â€“ key-value storage for quick lookup.  


## 2. Algorithms
An **algorithm** is a **step-by-step procedure** or set of rules to solve a problem or perform a task.  
It defines **how data is processed**.  

### Examples
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort (arrange data in order).  
- **Searching Algorithms**: Linear Search, Binary Search (find elements).  
- **Graph Algorithms**: Dijkstraâ€™s, BFS, DFS (find shortest path, traverse).  
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solve problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems (e.g., Fibonacci, Knapsack).  


## 3. Why DSA is Important
- Makes programs **faster** (better performance).  
- Makes programs **scalable** (handle more data efficiently).  
- Helps in **problem-solving and coding interviews** (big tech companies focus heavily on DSA).  
- Forms the foundation for advanced topics like **databases, operating systems, AI, and machine learning**.  


## ðŸ”‘ In Short
- **Data Structures** = *how you store data.*  
- **Algorithms** = *how you manipulate data.*  
Together, they allow you to **build efficient, reliable, and scalable software**.
